        Amplification to be applied to the signal pre-clipping.
    amplifier_clipping : float, optional
        Voltage (V) above which the amplified signal is clipped (in positive
        and negative values).
    noisy : boolean, optional
        Whether or not the antenna should add noise to incoming signals.
    unique_noise_waveforms : int, optional
        The number of expected noise waveforms needed for each received signal
        to have its own noise.

    Attributes
    ----------
    antenna : Antenna
        ``Antenna`` object extended by the front end.
    name : str
        Name of the antenna.
    position : array_like
        Vector position of the antenna.
    threshold : float
        Voltage sigma threshold for the trigger condition.
    trigger_window : float
        Time window (ns) for the trigger condition.
    amplification : float
        Amplification to be applied to the signal pre-clipping. Note that the
        usual ARA electronics amplification is already applied without this.
    amplifier_clipping : float
        Voltage (V) above which the amplified signal is clipped (in positive
        and negative values).
    is_hit
    is_hit_mc_truth
    signals
    waveforms
    all_waveforms
