* Added support for Askaryan model observed directly at the Cherenkov angle.

* Implemented alternative form factor for hadronic interactions in Askaryan model.

* Askaryan models now inherit from :class:`FunctionSignal`, improving the accuracy of their values after the application of multiple filters.

* All generator classes now have a :attr:`count` attribute for keeping track of the total number of events thrown.

* :attr:`Detector.antennas` attribute changed to :attr:`Detector.subsets`, which contains the pieces which make up the detector (e.g. antennas on a string, strings in a station).

* Iterating the :class:`Detector` class directly retains its effect of iterating each antenna in the detector directly.

.. rubric:: New Features
