Combining Effective Volume Simulations
======================================

In this example we will illustrate a set of files with effective volume data can be combined to produce a high-statistics effective volume curve. This code can be found in the combining_simulations.py script in the examples directory.

.. warning:: This script is intended to be run on the files output by the script in the previous example.
