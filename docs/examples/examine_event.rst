Examine a Single Event
======================

In this example we will generate a single event with a given vertex, direction, and energy, and then we'll examine the event by plotting the waveforms. This is typically useful for auditing events from a larger simulation. This code can be run from the `examine_event.py <https://github.com/bhokansonfasig/pyrex/blob/master/examples/examine_event.py>`_ script in the examples directory.
